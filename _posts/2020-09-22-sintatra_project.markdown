This Sinatra Project was very different from my last, I had take a little time off and gotten behind. But i had no clue what was waiting for me with this project, it was hellish. 

 The project was different this time, because not all of my cohort mates had made it this far. It felt like alot more pressure was riding on my shoulders this time and i could feel it the closer my dead line became, i still do as i havent completed my review yet, but i am confident in my abilities. 
 
 I needed alot more help this time around and learned alot about studying as well as getting help from mates. This proeject fealt alot more intensive, but, having been done the project(not the review) it feels really good to see my handiwork firsthand. I will write more once my review is done.
