When I first saw flatiron, honestly i had zero clue what it all entaled. Throw back to four weeks ago (feels like a year) when i was doing the bootcamp prep, not even the first mile. I had NO clue how interesting and busy it would get. fast forward two weeks to when im starting the first mile.. and I was soooo excited, I had met and been talking to a couple members of my cohort, i had been looking over some of the work and assignments and i was really excited to get going. 


     I still remember the first lab i completed, wasn't at all sure what i was doing, not sure of my self. But I kept going.
		 

As of now, I finished the FirstMile, and i have some time to myself, and to think, and man am I excited. When I started this program to be honest it was for the money, it was purely for the money, and for a nicer "portfolio" and image. But now that im done 2 weeks, I can say I get excited, just to learn. I usely talk to a couple guys in my cohort, who I believe i can say im friends with, and it helps me stay on track especially when im not doing so great, cus they always help me, and are usually around the same spot as me, and thats always nice. 

Honestly, I dont have alot to say this time, because theres not much more rn then just, Im super pumped, excited, to keep going and learning. So far i have been nothing but impressed by the way flatiron decides to teach, and keep their social enviroment.
