This was a very intimidating project and process. From the beginning I was not understanding javascript well, and the total weight of changing languages made its presence very known throughout the learning process. The main things I struggled with doing this project was:

   1. Learning, and adapting to Asynchronous coding
   2. Flow of data and functions
   3. Understanding and being able to manipulate the DOM well

When I started learning JavaScript I was very excited and eager to learn. As I kept studying material I was once again more confident in my ability however when I got to the project that changed. I had written about a third of my project, I had built my Rails API and was using a JavaScript `fetch()` request to I could'nt get my code to work, I could'nt select any DOM elements, after reviewing the material, That was when I realized that I was very mistaken, you see I thought JavaScript was synchronous, much like Ruby. And that was where I was wrong. So from there I had to figure out how to progress, I did so by calling abstracted methods inside my `fetch()` so that way the document would load before I tried to select any certain elements. 

Along that same line as what I was talking about before, I had a hard time understand the flow of work and how that played into JavaScript. Near the beginning of my project when I was starting to write my JavaScript, I Wasn't really abstracting methods and function good, infact I was trying to basically cram it all into one, once again ignoring the work flow. This resulted in very ugly, and not great working code. Definitely not a publishable work. So I took it upon myself to try to understand how I was going to do it different. I ended up abstracting almost all of my code into functions that did only one thing.. That way my code was clean and 'DRY'. This also resulted in a more understandable code, as well as a more flexible code if i were to add or change it. 

For my last trouble, I didnt fully understand the concept of purely using javascript to change the DOM. I was still relying and thinking along lines of hard-coding features into my HTML, obviously thats not what is wanted, nor is it 'sugar'. So I reviewed my material again, and I practiced and expiremented alooooot In consoles, as l as in my files just so I could get an idea of how to grasp it. This allowed me to be able to use JS confidently in changed elements in HTML and in the DOM for users.
