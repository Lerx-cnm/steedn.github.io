This blog post is dedicated to my first project, and the time and effort it took to finish it. When i first started my CLI project I have to say i was overwhelmed. It was late at night, I hadnt had much time to work on it due to moving, and overall i was a little shaky on what i was actually doing. I started talking to some of my friends from my cohort, and they recommended some videos to me, it turned out quite useful. I got my project started, with a little bit of planning. The planning didnt take very long, I had basically already figured out what i wanted my project to be about, but the actual application would be the hard part for me. 

After about 2 hours of research and review, I finally set to start my project. I was completely overwhelmed truth be told, I didnt even know what went where or what. But as i reviewed, and reviewed, things slowly began to make sense. I started with a small amount of code that we were advised to use, then i expiremented with different code, and combinations to try and find the most effective code and way to get what i wanted. My code, my CLI project, was an application that requested user input on a zip code, which then returned the current temperature, and the min and max temperatures. I researched a few different APIs to use before i finally found the one that i would end up using. Applying the API and code was indeed the hard part for me, so to help me I definitely reviewed previous class lectures, as well as assignments and labs. Google was also very useful to me during this, in particular situations in which i didnt know certain operators. 

When i was nearing the end, I began to try and make sure that all worked. So far it turned out that it looked pretty decent. I havent yet gotten a review but i am confident, and excited to learn. I am not to worried if they have alot of constructive criticism and that is exactly what i want, if anything. I always look forward to people critiuqing my work and helping me figure out even better, and more streamlined ways of doing problems that I may not have thought of before. 

Even though it seems i am not close to done this program, I get more and more excited about it everyday, not just to do it, but to learn and create things that I, by myself have created. I hope that in the future i can work even harder to get where i want to be, and where many others would want me to be at. I am excited for all the oppurtunitys of growth and learning that have been presented to me by Flatiron, it is nice.
