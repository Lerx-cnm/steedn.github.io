Throwback to the start of the first mile, I barely knew what coding was, barely knew what variables were. I was so confused when I started this program. Come back to the present now, passed my final review, learned all about objects, classes, React, etc. Im still so confused. And honestly I think thats okay, because I can code now, I am confident in my ability to code, and even more importantly im confident in my ability to learn. 

The biggest pieces of advice I would give to my self( and others starting) are these three things:
###### 1. Understand that its going to take alot of work, and thats okay.
###### 2. It will all be so worth it, you might not see it, but it truly will be.
###### 3. Helping others will ultimately reinforce concepts and ideas in your mind.


When I started this I had no clue just how much work I was gonna be spending on it, I thought it was just gonna be this easy slow paced program that half-assed things(sorry flatiron). I was wrong. I spent most of my days coding, on projects, or even just re-reading course material so that I could actually understand what was going on. I had to cancel social meetups so that I could just keep up with everybody else. Along with this concept is, you aren't alone, there will be other people with you that you may not know about, whether youre behind that class, ahead or just feeling like youre confused, I promise youre not the only one. Once you are able to accept that, the stress is way easier to deal with and you can much easier focus on just learning and understanding concepts. 

You are surrounded by code, everywhere, whether its Ruby, Rails, Javascript, React, C++, Python. It's everywhere, and its yours for the taking. Though my program did not cover Python nor C++, I've been studying them and noting all the similaritys between code languages. the construct, the setup, the design of it is all similar, and after completing this program I just know that myself and you will have such an easier time learning new languages and adapting to new situations. 

This one is huge. and honestly it can go the other way too, dont be afraid to reach out for help, and also don't be afraid to help others. I had to reach out to others sooooo much, almost annoyingly much, though they might not admit. You might have to do the same, and thats okay!! If youre stuck, get unstuck, however that may be. its as simple as that. But in terms of my original advice, help others, this will help you learn magnitudes faster and better than you couldve before, so do it. Take that step of helping others and itll all come together for you. 


My conclusion to all this. It feels surreal, weird that im now done. Theres so much more advice that could have been given, but to me those are the most important. I am excited to get a job and mroe importantly to be able to put myself in situations that I can adapt and learn from because of all the lessons ive learnt here. I am going to university again and I am glad that I had this oppurtinity so that i can apply what ive learned here to my studies. If you're thinking of doing this program, do it. It is rad.
